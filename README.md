Script for producing figures from Christiansen, Contreras Kallens &amp; Trecca (In Press) Towards A Comparative Approach to Language Acquisition. CDPS.

# Data origins

## isbilen_tallies.csv

Hand extracted from Isbilen (2021) meta analysis of auditory statistical learning studies

## many_babies_raw.csv

From Many Babies Infant-directed speech preference data, MB1. Clone repository https://github.com/manybabies/mb1-analysis-public and rename **processed_data/01_merged_output.csv**. Tally is produced in *process_data.R*. Processed into **many_babies.csv**.

## wordbank_data.csv

Used *wordbankr* package and processed in *process_data.R*

## childes_utterance_stats.csv

Used *childesr* package and processed in *process_data.R*

## slobin_tallies.csv

Hand extracted from Slobin, D. I. (2014). Before the beginning: The development of tools of the trade. Journal of Child Language, 41(S1), 1-17.

## language_data.csv

Hand constructed using Glottolog. First column (In_DB) contains the unique reference of each item in each of the previous databases.

**Note that the data from Kidd & Garcia (2021) is not publicly available. Please request it to the authors.**

# Scripts

## process_data.R

Reads and manipulates the data to generate a language by count dataframe. Generates **many_babies.csv**, **wordbank_data.csv** and **childes_utterance_stats.csv**.

## cdps_script.R

Reads all previous databases and aggregates over the target grouping. 

Generates:
* A *Genus* plot (**genus_plot**) showing the proportions of items for English, Romance, Germanic and Other languages.
* A *Family* plot (**family_plot**) showing the proportions of items for English, Other Indo-European and Non-Indo-European languages.
* A *Paper* plot (**cdps_family**) using a *subset* of the databases, namely Childes, Many Babies and Kidd & Garcia, showing the proportion of items for English, Other Indo-European and Non-Indo-European languages.

**Note again that the last paper can only be generated with the Kidd & Garcia (2021) data, not included in this repository**.
